- Issue new books by member ID and book number
- Return issued books with fine calculation
- Searchable book inventory

## Project structure

- `src/App.tsx` — main dashboard app and view routing
- `src/main.tsx` — React entrypoint
- `src/index.css` — global styles and Tailwind import
- `package.json` — dependencies and scripts

## Notes

- The app uses local seed data in `src/App.tsx` and does not require an API key or backend server.
- Data changes are stored only in memory during the current browser session.
- `npm run lint` runs TypeScript type checking with `tsc --noEmit`.

## Specification

- The original academic brief is available in `SPECIFICATION.md`.
- It describes the library schema, issue/return rules, grace period, and fine calculation.
